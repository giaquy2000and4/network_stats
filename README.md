# network_stats
Windows batch script that creates a real-time network monitor displaying WiFi details (SSID, adapter, state, signal strength) and performance metrics (ping, bytes sent/received). Uses netsh, ping, and netstat commands in a compact window that auto-refreshes to track network status and data transfer.
